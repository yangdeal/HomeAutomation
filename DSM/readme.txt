There are 2 versions in the folder:

1. Linux / bash version:
	This version is writen before DSM version. It require a Linux with mount camera file folder.
2. DSM / Busybox / ASH version:
	This version will run from DSM directly, easy to be managed from DSM task scheduler and no additonal Linux server required. This version prepared becase of DSM do not support some function, such as sort -R, shut. DSM ash function is limited.

DSM version should be maintaned and used.
